* ### [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akshayasrinivasan2/drought-prediction-using-ml-algorithms/data)
  These data were obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center and i will work on one million row from 2000 to 2016 and it have 32 feature
  
  
  
  
* ### challenges
  * data have nulls
  * data have outliers
  * generate features from old features
  * filter features and take the most importanat features
  * unbalanced data

* my aim from this data is to make it prepared for machine learning algorithms
 
* questions
  * what happen if humidity increases or decreases
  * what happen if temperature increased or decreased
  * what is the months drought is high in it
  * The most drought-prone places

* ### features
