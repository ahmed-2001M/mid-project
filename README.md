* ### challenges
  * data have nulls
  * data have outliers
  * generate features from old features
  * filter features and take the most importanat features
  * unbalanced data

* ### questions
  * is month have relation with drought
  * how change in hmudity affect on drought
  * how change in temprature affect on drought
  * what is the time temprature is high
